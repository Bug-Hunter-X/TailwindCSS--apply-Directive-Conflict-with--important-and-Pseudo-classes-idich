The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with custom directives.  If the custom directive contains a pseudo-class selector (like `&:hover`) and the base class is defined with important flags (!important), the `@apply` directive may not apply the hover styles correctly. This is because the !important flag on the base class overrides the styles applied by `@apply` on hover.
